The whole structure of the database can be initialized through `databaseInit.sql` under the main directory in the *cslinux MySQL console*, this will generate all enough structure, as well as Managers and Admins, but without any **Customer** or **Sales Reps** to be used. If for some reasons it requires username and password, try `hnyzx3` as username and `20126507` as password. 

The scripts below are a copy of `databaseInit.sql`

```mysql

Assuming that the user, as the administrator of the system, has enough knowledge to work on manipulation of MySQL, he/she can operate 'just like sudo in terminal' by typing **MySQL scripts** to the textbox and click **execute**.

You can exit this **Terminal** and back to login page by typing "exit()" and execute.

depending on the your scripts, it will pop up windows showing different messages or JSON objects returned by database.

### System-wide Evaluation

#### Privacy

User privacy matters a lot, in this approach, to prevent from leaking of password though database storage, this system stores user's password by applying **SHA-256** algorithm on it, rather than purely store bare password in to a fragile database that might be cracked at any time. In this approach, even if your "password" from the database has leaked, people who get this "SHA"ed password still cannot retrieve your original password because SHA-256 algorithm by far cannot reverse engineering. Moreover, this encryption happens in the front-end, both at sign up or login, so that it will never transmit unencrypted password in the unsafe internet.



#### Stability

This system has embedded with Google's **reCAPTCHA** on login, sign up as well as updating user information procedure, which can prevent those spam and abuse and make sure that it is REAL HUMAN who is using your system. Even so, it has not yet been equipped with anti-DDoS modules, which might be a vulnerability when it, as a global system, is further deployed on public internet.



#### Security

This website uses Session to keep the connection between browser and server, however, it's not safe enough as anyone can cheat with server because it's a non-HTTPS connection. To solve this issue and enhance security, a **unique *Session ID*** will be created once the user login. this *Session ID* consists of the concatenation of your username and password, which have already applied SHA-256, and then apply SHA-256 the second time. In this encryption approach, every time user send a HTTP request, the server will evaluate the *Session ID* first, before doing anything related to database manipulation.

This website **catches any error** made by using PHP connecting to database, in this scheme, if any unrecoverable error happened, server will redirect user to 503 page, in order to prevent from doing anything harmful to the database.

This website generally applies PDO parameter binding on every SQL statements that has user input in it, which can largely prevent **SQL Injection Attack** when applied on public internet, and thus protect the database from malicious and unexpected manipulation.



#### Performance

As we all know, JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it has one call stack and one memory heap. this might appear that this synchronous might be harmful when communicating with the internet. To solve this blocking, this system generally applies **Asynchronous** to all Ajax requests by utilizing **Callback** functions features, which will not be blocked on stack if the internet connection is unstable or lost. Moreover, every single POST request requires a JSON_status to be echoed, this also stops it from having bad or interrupted executions on the server-side, but unknown by the client-side.



#### Data Visualization

From my point of view, data cannot be fully understood if without **Visualizing** it. Nowadays, thanks for the contribution from people in Ant Financial, I could use the open source libraries they provide to visualize the data from database into interactive 2D plots. Thus will reduce the difficulty in featuring, classification and monitoring or those data in a large scale. 



#### Vulnerability

The Administrator Page gives Admin a command windows and sudo privilege on manipulation of the whole database. Even if the executing the SQL scripts requires double check of login status, there might still have possibility that the admin account been leaked.
